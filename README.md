## Introduction

These development principles are developed having in the back of the mind the software world and it's equations of hierarchization, however, one could generally put them to work in extraneous realms: the development of a company, of a community, of a selfhood.


## the 1st Development Principle

<b>Arbitrary, but consistent.</b>

Consistent arbitrariness is the foundation of the most sharp tool humanity has ever devised, language itself. Why these certain graphemes are linked to those certain phonemes and this certain assemblage points towards that certain concept or object? Because we have arbitrarily chosen so. However, it is the long-term consistency (sometimes for millennia within the same frame of entanglement of words, things, and thoughts) which allows our extended communities to develop the making of fire into the making of computers.


## the 2nd Development Principle

<b>Slow, but constant.</b>

The speed of light is the fastest a particle-wave could possibly move. It might very well be an absolute limit. We discovered that the universe is so grand that this awe-filling speed could just as well be closer to nothing, because at the scale of the universe it needs millions and billions of human years to achieve meaningful displacement. However, regardless the speed of movement and the time required, the fact that the movement always exists, that there is always progress, a forward succeeding another forward, this is the important fact. If development is the target, one can afford to go slow towards it if constant progress is achieved, and sometimes slowness should be encouraged where the hastiness of today might hinder the progress of trans-tomorrow (the day after the day after tomorrow).


## the 3rd Development Principle

<b>Imperfect, but cooperative.</b>

The disablement of the superficial indicates the soon to come disappearance of the essence. The death of natural is only followed by the fall of the artificial. No matter how imperfect a living system is, because it is live, if no other better system exists, then it must be always kept alive. The system should always respond to user input, striving for the best response, but more importantly, always cooperating with the user's interests.


## the 4th Development Principle

<b>Destroy, but calmly.</b>

Some of the systems are in such a state that one cannot even say that they need rethinking, that would imply thinking was involved in their conception. For such systems destruction is the only possible way for evolution. However, one should not be too hot-headed when engaging onto the path of destruction, should not fall prey to the pleasures of dismantling. Being able to achieve a state of calmness when worlds fall apart is the measure, to some extent, of wisdom.


## the 5th Development Principle

<b>Untrustful, but coordinated.</b>

Services should not rely on each other, but they should optimistically await a response and optimistically reply.
